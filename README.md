# Project Description

This prgogram is a C++ implementation of the functionality of an [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine). Enigma is the common name for the coding machine used by German forces in the Second World War. Two machines set up in the same way allowed the sending of a message securely between their users.

This program allows for simple input/output operations to configure the Enigma machine from command line arguments and configuration files. The Enigma machine encrypts (or decrypts) messages provided on the standard input stream, outputting the encrypted (or decrypted) message on the standard output stream.

The implementation of the Enigma and its components is done using C++ object oriented concepts.
